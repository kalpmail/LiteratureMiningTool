23624317	Influence of variants in the NPY gene on obesity and metabolic syndrome features in Spanish children.
23624317	Variants in the neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene have been associated with obesity and its traits. 
23624317	The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the neuropeptide Y gene with obesity, metabolic syndrome features, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk biomarkers in Spanish children. 
23624317	We recruited 292 obese children and 242 normal-body mass index (BMI) children. 
23624317	Height, weight, -body mass index, waist circumference, clinical and metabolic markers, adipokines, and inflammatory (PCR, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-Î±) and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers (MPO, MMP-9, sE-selectin, sVCAM, sICAM, and PAI-1) were analyzed. 
23624317	Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms in the neuropeptide Y gene were genotyped. 
23624317	The results of our study indicate that anthropometric measurements, clinical and metabolic markers, adipokines (leptin and resistin), and inflammatory and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers were generally elevated in the obese group. 
23624317	The exceptions to this finding included cholesterol, HDL-c, and adiponectin, which were lower in the obese group, and glucose, LDL-c, and MMP-9, which did not differ between the groups. 
23624317	Both rs16147 and rs16131 were associated with the risk of obesity, and the latter was also associated with insulin resistance, triacylglycerols, leptin, and HDL-c. 
23624317	Thus, we confirm the association of rs16147 with obesity, and we demonstrate for the first time the association of rs16131 with obesity and its possible impact on the early onset of metabolic syndrome features, mainly triacylglycerols, in children.
23624366	Treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma with intravenous fotemustine.
23624366	The purpose of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and activity of intravenous fotemustine in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. 
23624366	We report on a series of 25 consecutive patients diagnosed with metastatic uveal melanoma. 
23624366	Fotemustine was administered intravenously as a first-line treatment to all patients. 
23624366	Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (any grade) were observed in 60 and 52% of patients, respectively. 
23624366	Only two patients discontinued treatment because of toxicity (G3 thrombocytopenia), whereas all other patients were discontinued for progressive disease. 
23624366	Two partial responses were observed. Nine patients had stable disease (disease control rate=44%). 
23624366	The median survival duration was 13.9 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 60%. 
23624366	Intravenous fotemustine is well tolerated and could improve the outcome of metastatic uveal melanoma patients with or without liver involvement, although a randomized prospective trial is required to confirm these results.
23624446	Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease in a multiracial Asian country.
23624446	This study examined the characteristics and trends in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among children in Singapore.
23624446	We retrospectively reviewed all patients under 18 years diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease over a 14-year period. 
23624446	Information on demographics, disease presentation, laboratory findings, radiological investigations, and endoscopic and histological findings were obtained from the patients' medical records.
23624446	32 patients were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, 30 of whom had Crohn's disease and 2 had ulcerative colitis. 
23624446	The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease rose from an initial rate of 2.2 per 100,000 patients in the year 2000 to a peak of 11.4 patients per 100,000 patients by 2008. 
23624446	Median age of onset of symptoms was 10.5 years. 
23624446	There were more boys (63%) than girls in the group and a higher representation of Indians (34.4%). 
23624446	The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (87.5%), diarrhoea (75.0%) and weight loss (71.9%). 
23624446	Extraintestinal manifestations such as fever and arthralgia were found in over 50% of patients. 
23624446	The most common physical findings were perianal abnormalities (56.3%), mouth ulcers (37.5%) and growth failure (15.6%). 
23624446	Abnormal laboratory findings such as low albumin, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anaemia, thrombocytosis and high C-reactive protein were found in nearly half of the patients. 
23624446	Endoscopic and histological findings showed that a majority of patients (90.6%) also had evidence of inflammation in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
23624446	Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease is on the rise. 
23624446	The higher occurrence in Indians, earlier onset and more florid presentation may suggest different genetic and environmental influences specific to Asian children.
